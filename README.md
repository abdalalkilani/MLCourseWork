# Produce evaluation metrics
## Produce evaluation metrics without a depth requirement

**Warning: running this will take a very very long time (approximately 10 hours for a dataset of size 2000x7)**
The reason behind this is that we treat the maximum depth of the tree as a hyperparamter and tune it using 10 fold cross-validation. While this does produce accurate results, it does take a lot of time to run.

To run this: 
1. Ensure that you are in the directory containing the ´main.py´ file
